                <h2>Ground level or ambient ozone (O3)</h2>
                <p>Health Effects: Ground level O3 can irritate the airways of the lungs, and increase symtpoms of those suffering from respiratory diseases.</p>
                <p>Background: Ground level O3 is not emitted directly into the air, but created by chemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds
                in the presence of sunlight. Emissions from industrial facilities and electric utilities, motor vehicle exhust, gasoline vapors, and chemical solvents
                are some of the major sources of the sources of O3.</p>
                <h2>Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)</h2>
                <p>Health Effects: NO2 can irritate the lungs and lower resistance to respiratory infections and diseases.</p>
                <p>Background: NO2 is part of a group of highly reactive cases and primarily gets into the air from the burning of fuel. NO2 forms from the emission of
                  cars, trucks, buses, powerpants, and off-road equiptment.</p>
                <h2>Sulphur Dioxide (SO2)</h2>
                <p>Health Effects: SO2 even in moderate concentrations may result in decrease in lung function.</p>
                <p>Background: The largest source of SO2 in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels by power plants
                  and other industrial facilities. Smaller sources of SO2 emissions include industrial processes
                  such as extracting metal from ore and locomotives, ships, and other vehicles and heavy equiptment that burn fuel with a high sulfur content.</p>
                <h2>Carbon Monoxide (CO)</h2>
                <p>Health Effects: CO prevents normal transport of oxygen by the blood and can lead to sginficiant reduction in the supply of oxygen and impact those with heart disease.</p>
                <p>Background: CO is a colorless and odorless gas that is harmful when inhaled in large amounts. The greatest sources of CO are cars, trucks, and other vehicle or machinery that burn fossil fuels. </p>

        <h2>POLLUTION</h2>
        <p>Data was obtained from the EPA which collects data about various pollutants through the use of air monitors placed in a variety of locations.</p>
        <img src="aqi.png" width=300 height=300</img src>
        <h2>MORTALITY</h2>
        <p>Data about mortality was obtained through the California Department of Public Health.
          Chronic lower respiratory disease, heart disease, stroke, and cancer were examined in this visualization
          to determine if there is a relation between air quality measurements and mortality per 100,000 people in various locations in California. </p>
        <h2>POLLUTION AND MORTALITY</h2>
        <p>O3 is more prevalent when there is more sunlight so the summer months will have higher levels of O3.
          The other pollutants NO2, SO2, and CO more prevalent with more humidity so they are more prevalent in the winter months.
          Most of the pollutants affect respiratory diseases due to lung irritation. CO will affect the heart as wells ince it interferes with oxygen availability in the blood. </p>
